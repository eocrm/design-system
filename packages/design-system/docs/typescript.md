# TypeScript

Getting prop types to resolve in your editor.

Every prop and variant type is typed. If your editor shows no types:

- Confirm `moduleResolution: "bundler"` (or `"node16"`) in your `tsconfig.json`.
- Confirm your IDE's TS server is running.
- The package's `types` field points at `./src/index.ts` — source distribution means the consumer's bundler compiles `.tsx`. Vite, Next.js, Webpack 5+ all support this; older configurations may need `transpilePackages: ['@eocrm/design-system']` (Next.js) or equivalent.
