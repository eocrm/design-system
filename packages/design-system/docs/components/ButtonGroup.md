# `<ButtonGroup>` — joined Buttons + segmented control

```tsx
// Visual mode — joined Buttons, no shared state.
<ButtonGroup aria-label="Edit actions">
  <Button>Cut</Button>
  <Button>Copy</Button>
  <Button>Paste</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

// Segmented mode — single-select toggle group.
<ButtonGroup value={view} onValueChange={setView} aria-label="View mode">
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="grid">Grid</ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="list">List</ButtonGroup.Item>
  <ButtonGroup.Item value="calendar">Calendar</ButtonGroup.Item>
</ButtonGroup>
```

- **Mode detection** is by props: with `value` + `onValueChange` you get segmented; without, you get visual joining.
- **Children differ by mode.** Visual: `<Button>` children. Segmented: `<ButtonGroup.Item>` children. Mixing the two is undefined behavior.
- **Size propagation** — `size` on the group propagates to children. Per-child override wins.
- **Keyboard nav (segmented only)** — Arrow keys move selection + focus; Home / End jump to ends; Tab moves IN/OUT of the group on the currently-selected item. Disabled items are skipped.
- **ARIA** — visual mode is `role="group"`; segmented mode is `role="radiogroup"` (requires `aria-label`).

**Anti-patterns:**

- ❌ Mixing visual `<Button>` children with `<ButtonGroup.Item>` in the same ButtonGroup — undefined behavior.
- ❌ Using ButtonGroup as a routing tab strip. That's what `<Tabs>` is for.
- ❌ Passing only `value` without `onValueChange` — type error.
- ❌ Multi-select via clever workarounds. Compose Checkboxes for that.

**See also:** `<Tabs>` for routing-style content switching, `<Radio>` for vertical radio lists.
