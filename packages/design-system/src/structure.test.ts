/**
 * Hard rule 10: `aria-busy` alone never reaches a screen reader.
 *
 * This walks the tree rather than checking a list, because the list is the
 * thing that rots — four components shipped with `aria-busy` and nothing else,
 * and each was found by a human reading rather than by a test. Any file that
 * sets `aria-busy` must also carry one of the two sanctioned mechanisms:
 * a component-owned live region, or a state word folded into the accessible
 * name via a visually-hidden span.
 *
 * Deliberately coarse. It cannot tell whether the mechanism is wired to the
 * same state as the `aria-busy`, and a component whose transient state never
 * sets `aria-busy` at all is invisible to it. It closes the one failure mode
 * that has actually happened, and stays cheap enough not to rot.
