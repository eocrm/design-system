/**
 * Hard rule 10: `aria-busy` alone never reaches a screen reader.
 *
 * This asserts ONE thing: a file that sets `aria-busy` also carries one of the
 * sanctioned mechanisms. It deliberately does NOT try to decide whether the
 * mechanism is rendered unconditionally, whether it is wired to the same state,
 * or whether it sits somewhere that would prune it.
 *
 * That restraint is the finding, not a shortcut. Two rounds of review were
 * spent on versions that tried:
 *
 *   v1 matched raw text, so a token name inside a `{/* comment *\/}` satisfied
 *      it, and `ErrorState` both entered and passed the check off a JSDoc
 *      `@example` — trigger and pass, zero runtime code.
 *   v2 stripped comments and rejected `cond && <span role="status">`. It caught
 *      that literal shape and nothing else: wrapping the same conditional
 *      region in a <div> or a fragment passed, because the attribute is no
 *      longer in the opening tag the regex reaches. It also produced two false
 *      alarms — one legitimate conditional region anywhere in a file poisoned
 *      an unrelated correct one, and the natural name-fold shape
 *      `<span className={styles.srOnly}>{loading && t('x')}</span>` was
 *      rejected outright.
 *
 * Deciding "is this JSX conditional, and does it wrap that attribute" needs a
 * parser, not a regex. A gate that answers one question correctly is worth more
 * than one that answers two badly and cries wolf on correct code — the false
 * alarms are the part that gets a gate deleted.
 *
 * So: comments stripped on both sides, mechanism must exist. Placement,
 * conditionality and state-wiring are reviewed by humans and pinned by the
 * per-component tests in Switch/StatusMenu/DataTable, which assert the
 * behaviour rather than the shape.
